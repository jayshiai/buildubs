## Usage

- `Popover` component takes in `trigger` prop.
- `trigger` prop is the component that triggers the popover to open. It is required. It can be any `React Component` or even a simple `string`.

interface PopoverProps {
  trigger: React.ReactNode;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}
```

## Customizable Design

More granular components provide you with more control over the design of the `Popover` component. You can customize the design of the `Popover` component by using the following sub-components:

<ComponentPreview
  name="popover-granular"
/>
- Style of every sub-component of the Popover component can be customized using the `className` prop.
- Pass in a `CSS class` or use `Tailwind CSS` utility classes to style the Popover component.
