<ComponentPreview
  name="accordion-demo"
  className="[&_.preview>[data-orientation=vertical]]:sm:max-w-[70%]"
  description="An accordion with items"
/>

## Usage

- The Accordion component takes in `items` prop and renders Accordion based on it.
### Interface for AccordionProps
 ```tsx
 interface AccordionItemProps {
  title: string;
  content: React.ReactNode;
}

interface AccordionProps {
  className?: string;
  items: AccordionItemProps[];
}
 ```
- The `items` prop is an array of objects with `title` and `content` properties.
- The `title` prop is a string that represents the title of the accordion item.
- The `content` prop is a ReactNode that represents the content of the accordion item. Which means you can pass in `string` or even a `React Component` and the `Accordion` will automatically handle it.

### Example of `items` prop
```tsx
 const data = [
    {
      title: "What is DubsUI?",
      content: `DubsUI is a component library for React.js
         that provides a set of reusable components 
         for building web applications.`,
    },
    {
      title: "Who maintains DubsUI?",
      content: (
        <p>
          <a
            className=" text-blue-600 underline"
            href="https://github.com/jayshiai"
          >
            @jayshiai
          </a>{" "}
          along with 3Dubs under DevsTomorrow maintain DubsUI.
        </p>
      ),
    },
    {
      title: "What does DubsUI stand out for?",
      content: `DubsUI aims to provide a more data 
        focused approach to building web applications, 
        where user provides data and DubsUI takes
         care of the rest. However it also 
         alows for more granular control on 
         the design of components.`,
    },
    {
      title: "What insprised DubsUI?",
      content: `DubsUI is mainly built on top of 
        Radix UI and derives some inspiration 
        from shandcnUI.`,
    },
  ]
```
## Customizable Design
More granular components provide you with more control over the design of the Accordion component. You can customize the design of the Accordion component by using the following sub-components:

<ComponentPreview
  name="accordion-granular"
  className="[&_.preview>[data-orientation=vertical]]:sm:max-w-[70%]"
  description="An accordion with items"
/>
- Style of every sub-component of the Accordion component can be customized using the `className` prop. 
- Pass in a `CSS class` or use `Tailwind CSS` utility classes to style the Accordion component.
