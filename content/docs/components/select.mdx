## Usage
- `Select` component takes in `items` and `placeholder` props.
- `className` prop is used to style the "trigger" part of Select.
- `placeholder` renders the placeholder value of Select. It is a required prop. It accepts `string` value.
- `items` prop is an array of objects. It contains:
    - `label` prop which is the label of the option.
    - `value` prop which is the value of the option.
    - `disabled` prop which is a boolean value. If `true`, the option will be disabled i.e. It will be visible but not clickable.
- `Select` also allows for grouping of options. To group options, insted of passing `value` and `label` pass `items` and `label`, where `label` is the group label and `items` is an array of options.
- Refer to example below to see how to group options.
### Interface for SelectProps
```tsx
interface SelectItemType {
  value?: string;
  label: string;
  items?: SelectItemType[];
  disabled?: boolean;
}

interface SelectProps extends SelectPrimitive.SelectProps {
  items: SelectItemType[];
  placeholder: string;
  className?: string;
}
```

### Example of `items` prop
```tsx
 const items = [
    {
      label: "Fruits",
      items: [
        { value: "apple", label: "Apple" },
        { value: "banana", label: "Banana" },
        { value: "blueberry", label: "Blueberry" },
        { value: "grapes", label: "Grapes" },
        { value: "pineapple", label: "Pineapple" },
      ],
    },
    {
      label: "Vegetables",
      items: [
        { value: "aubergine", label: "Aubergine" },
        { value: "broccoli", label: "Broccoli" },
        { value: "carrot", label: "Carrot", disabled: true },
        { value: "courgette", label: "Courgette" },
        { value: "leek", label: "Leek" },
      ],
    },
    {
      label: "Meat",
      items: [
        { value: "beef", label: "Beef" },
        { value: "chicken", label: "Chicken" },
        { value: "lamb", label: "Lamb" },
        { value: "pork", label: "Pork" },
      ],
    },
  ];
```
- This will render a Select component with 3 groups of options: Fruits, Vegetables, and Meat. Each group will have a list of options.

## Customizable Design
More granular components provide you with more control over the design of the `Select` component. You can customize the design of the `Select` component by using the following sub-components:

<ComponentPreview
  name="select-granular"
/>

- Style of every sub-component of the Select component can be customized using the `className` prop.
- Pass in a `CSS class` or use `Tailwind CSS` utility classes to style the Select component.
