<ComponentPreview

## Usage 
- `Dialog` component takes in props `trigger`, `title` and `description`.
- `trigger` prop is the component that triggers the dialog to open. It is required. I can be any `React Component` or even a simple `string`.
- `title` and `description` are just the text that is displayed in the dialog. They are optional.
### Interface for DialogProps
```tsx
interface DialogProps {
    trigger: React.ReactNode;
    title?: string;
    description?: string;
    children?: React.ReactNode;
}
```

## Customizable Design
More granular components provide you with more control over the design of the `Dialog` component. You can customize the design of the `Dialog` component by using the following sub-components:

<ComponentPreview
  name="dialog-granular"
/>

- Style of every sub-component of the Dialog component can be customized using the `className` prop.
- Pass in a `CSS class` or use `Tailwind CSS` utility classes to style the Dialog component.
