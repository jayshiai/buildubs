## Usage 
- `Collapsible` component takes in `title` and `show` props.
- `Children` of `Collapsible` component are rendered inside collapsible panel.
- `title` prop is the title of the collapsible panel. It is a required prop. It accepts `ReactNode` so it can be a `string` or even a `React Component`.
- `show` prop takes in number. It decides how many items of collapsible are shown in an _**uncollapsed**_ state. Default value is `0`. It is an optional prop. It can take `negative` values as well which mean that number of component will be hidden in uncollapsed state.

### Interface for CollapsibleProps
```tsx
interface CollapsibleProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  title: React.ReactNode;
  show?: number;
}
```

## Customizable Design 
More granular components provide you with more control over the design of the `Collapsible` component. You can customize the design of the `Collapsible` component by using the following sub-components:
<ComponentPreview
  name="collapsible-granular"
/>
- Style of every sub-component of the Avatar component can be customized using the `className` prop.
- Pass in a `CSS class` or use `Tailwind CSS` utility classes to style the Avatar component.
