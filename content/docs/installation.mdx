### Install
Install the library in your project using the following command:

```bash
npm install dubsui
```

### Styling 
The components come prestyled. The styles are bundled with the library. 

__Your bundler should pick up the styles and start using them. If it doesn't, just import the styles as follow:__   

```jsx
import "dubsui/css"
```

Make sure to import it in your base `layout` file and before your `global.css` to avoid style conflicts.


```jsx
import "dubsui/css"
import "global.css"
```

#### TailwindCSS
If you are using TailwindCSS, refer to TailwindCSS page to cofigure your Tailwindcss to generate styles for components.
